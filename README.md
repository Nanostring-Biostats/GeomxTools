## Overview

The GeoMxTools package contains tools for analyzing data from
NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). It provides functions
to read, quality control (QC) and normalize starting from Nanostring
DCC and PKC files generated from the NanoString GeoMx DSP.

It contains the definition of the NanoStringGeoMxSet class which
inherits from Biobaseâ€™s ExpressionSet class and NanoStringRCCSet class.
